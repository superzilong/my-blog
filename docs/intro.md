# My Introduction

## Programming

I am a programmer based in Wuhan, China.

I studied from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and my major is Mechanical Design, Manufacture and Automation.

C++ is my primary programming language and I have been using it to develop CAE software for more than ten years. I am good at designing Desktop App architecture and implementing Computer Graphic functionalities. With no doubt, C++ is the first class to
implement efficient algorithms and the Desktop CG Apps with high performance requirement.

Python is my secondary language. I like the design of Python because we can use the concise sentences to implement powerful functionalities(like AI and Web). As a script language, we can easily to use it to make easy and repeated work to be automatic.

During the Internet age, we cannot leave PC Web browser and mobile phones. Javascript can easily construct the UI in these devices. React and its ecosystem can make these work easier.

## Tools

I mainly work on Windows Operate System and Visual Studio is my productivity tools. I like to use Jetbrain's Reshaper C++ extension which is so intelligent and make my work more fluent.

Visual Studio Code is my favorite lightweight IDE and I like to use it to implement my side projects.

I like to use vim because it can keep my hands on the keyboards and make my input work more efficient.

I also enjoy working on the Linux environment because I like working on the CLI more than GUI. 

## Hobby

I love painting, guitar and basketball.
